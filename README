README for wine-dummy
----------------------

This dummy Debian pacakge was created to satisfy users that install
wine from sources, but who would like to use wintricks.

As winetricks depends on package "wine", the locally installed wine is
not known to dpkg. However, winetricks also depends on "wine-dummy" as
a last resort.

INSTALL

apt-get install equivs

make
dpkg -i wine-dummy*.deb
apt-get install winetricks
