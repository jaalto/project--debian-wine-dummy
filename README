wine-dummy - A dummy Debian package
-----------------------------------

    A dummy Debian package to satisfy users that install wine from
    sources, but who would like to use
    <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/winetricks>.

    As winetricks depends on package "wine", the locally installed
    wine will not be known to dpkg. However, winetricks also depends
    on "wine-dummy" as a last resort. With this, you can generate
    wine-dummy.*deb for use with winetricks.
