wine-dummy - A dummy Debian package
-----------------------------------

    A dummy Debian package to mark "wine" as being installed in Debian to
    satisfy users that install wine from
    sources

    The locally installed wine will not be known to Debian package
    system (dpkg) and some package require that a package "wine" is
    present before they can be installed. With this, you can generate
    a dummy wine*.deb for use to satisfy depends.
