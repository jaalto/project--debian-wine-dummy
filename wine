Description: dummy package to provide feature wine
 The sole purpose of is to provide a dummy package to provide "wine"
 .
 This situation raises in cases where use may have got wine directly
 from development site, installed it locally, and then try to install
 some package that requires "wine". Since the wine was installed out
 of Debian's control, dpkg woudn't know about it and would try to
 install "wine" from official repositories; effectively causing
 problems to existing wine installation.
 .
 Warning: install this package only if you already have a
 working wine installation compiled by yourself.
